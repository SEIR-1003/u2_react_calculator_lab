# React Calculator Lab

As you have seen so far between JS to DOM Manipulation, the React DOM with State and Hooks, one of the most important parts of this field is building up on our existing skills and abilities.

A few weeks ago, we built up a basic calculator in Vanilla JS, now lets take this up a notch and build up another Calculator in React.

You can use your previous Calculator as a reference for styling and layout, the goal of this lesson is going to be converting our old HTML inputs into React data held in State, using our onClick functionality for each button, and working with our JSX format


We encourage you to reach out and look for resources and guides online, not only to help you build this project, but also to take the time to see seriously measure what kind of resources are out there, and your ability to filter through old, outdated references.

Start simple, just using our basic 4 Math operators. When you get those working, take it up a notch by experimenting with other Math functions in JS!
